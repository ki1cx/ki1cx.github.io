Is Bitcoin done with it's correction? No one really knows, but we can use [Elliot Wave Principle][2] to make some predictions. With strong correlation to corrective waves past observed, we can make some conjectures. The BTC/Dollar chart below shows strikingly similar resemblence to the Triple Three correction.

Here is the Triple Three corrective wave described by Elliot Wave Principle.

From [Elliottwave Forecast][1]

Go to a bigger weekly time frame and we can see that BTC got a significant bounce at the 0.618 Fib level. Typically the low will be retested for the market to confirm that the bottom has been put in. If it makes a lower low, then there is a high probability that BTC will go down further into the $4k range.

Here are the 3 major levels of support.

1. Double bottom @ ~$6k
2. 0.786 Fib level @ ~$4k
3. 100 Weekly SMA @ ~$3k
