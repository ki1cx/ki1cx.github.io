title:  Bitcoin - our future is bright
description: Blockchain is the technology behind Bitcoin, but it is certainly not what is fueling Bitcoin. Rather, it is Bitcoin fueling the blockchain technology. Bitcoin is very much ingrained in the psychy of the people more than we all realize. Only a small fraction of the world population is waking up to it, but the dormant ones will in time. And it is just a matter of time. There is a bright future, beause we need it.

Blockchain could not exist without Bitcoin, because it is not the technology that moves people. It is the hope that we can make a better future for ourselves and our future generations. Statistically improbable, because hope is only realized when a significant amount of the population believes in it togther whole heartedly. As Steve Jobs once said. Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. It is a very special kind of emotion. It is powerful, lasting, and has depth. It is the belief that we can create our own destiny, because have to. 

Many people see the world as a struggle between good and bad. And it appears that way from an angle. Like a 3d object projected on a 2d plane. Maybe it's our inability to see the larger picture. What if our experiences are just vibrations formed by waves of infinite combinations. From chaos you find order. Perhaps it is like the rythm that moves us. When waves form harmonics, the vibrations create consciousness. At a certain frequency, it creates existance. Large fluctuaions of the amplitude creates experiences. 

Blockchain is the technology behind Bitcoin, but it is certainly not what is fueling Bitcoin. Rather, it is Bitcoin fueling the blockchain technology. Bitcoin is very much ingrained in the psychy of the people more than we all realize. Only a small fraction of the world population is waking up to it, but the dormant ones will in time. And it is just a matter of time. There is a bright future, beause we need it. Our war is the fight for our financial freedom. It is the culmination of all the wars of our ancestors past. To leap forward into a better future, we have to fight for our freedom from financial bondage. Change won't be overnight, but as we have experienced information freedom accelerated with the help of the internet, Bitcoin will be a nuclear powered rocket for change. Money affects everyone. There won't be a single human on the planet not affected by the changes brought by Bitcoin. It is an idea come to fruition, because we are actively participating in the realization.

I'm very optimistic about our future. It is the struggles that drives us to make the world a better place. We are at the cusp of a very big change. We will see a truely global world where all borders will come down, because of what Bitcoin stands for.
